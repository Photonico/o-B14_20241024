\maketitle

\par Bulk orthorhombic boron (\ce{o-B14}) is a recently predicted, three-dimensional boron allotrope which has fascinating properties\cite{bulk_boron}. 
Its structure is characterized by edge-sharing pentagonal bipyramids with diverse bond lengths ranging from $1.644$ to $1.966$ \AA as shown in the Figure below.
These structural motifs facilitate the formation of unusual seven-centre-two-electron $\pi$-bonds, which are identified for the first time in three-dimensional boron allotropes.
The presence of these bonds highlights the complexity and versatility of boron chemistry under ambient conditions.
Moreover, this material is predicted to be a superconductor with a Tc value of 29.1 K.

\par The present work employs the first-principles calculations based on the GGA-PBE functional to explore the atomic and electronic properties of \ce{o-B14}
The result would provide insight into the electronic band structure, density of states, and bonding characteristics.
Moreover, we further investigate the optical and plasma dispersion properties of \ce{o-B14}.
These calculations would reveal distinctive anisotropic behaviors, boradening its potential applications in plasmonics and beyond.

\par The calculation of bandstructure exhibits its metallic behavior with three bands crossing the Fermi level.
These bands consist of steep bands and flat bands near the Fermi level.
The steep bands promote high electron velocities, while the flat bands enhance the density of states and favor electronic interactions.

\par Such electronic features suggest the potential for unique transport and quantum properties.
Furthermore, within the structural iunits, we observed a strong orbital hybridization between the B 2p orbitals.
It reinforces the stability of the bonding framework.
The anticipated plasmonic and optical responses, driven by the anisotropic bonding network, offer promising opportunities for advanced optoelectronic and quantum devices.
